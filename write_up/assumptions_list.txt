A. Radio-waves
   + Polarization is parallel to the plane of incidence
   + Air is dispersive, linear medium with no free charge, but there is free current
   + Perimittivity of air is permittivity of free space
   + Dielectric constant of air is constant with temperture, pressure, and humidity
B. Ocean Waves

C. Ionosphere
<<<<<<< HEAD
    + Radio-waves only interact with electrons in ionosphere
    + N = N(z) != N(x,y,z)
        ++ Neglect curvature of Earth. 
    + Refractive index:
	++ Ignore Earth's magnetic field.
