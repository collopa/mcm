A. Radio-waves
   + Polarization is parallel to the plane of incidence
   + Air is linear medium with no free charge and no free current
   + Perimittivity of air is permittivity of free space
   + Dielectric constant of air is constant with temperture, pressure, and humidity
B. Ocean Waves

C. Ionosphere
    + Radio-waves only interact with electrons in ionosphere
