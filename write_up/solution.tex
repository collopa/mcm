\section*{MCM Requirements}

Hi team, here is what we \emph{need} to have in our report (according to the MCM overlords):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Restatement and clarification of the problem
    \item Explain assumptions and rationale/justification
    \item Include your model design and justification
    \item Describe model testing and sensitivity analysis
    \item Discuss the strengths and weaknesses
\end{itemize}

They also claim to judge the quality of our writing. So remember our good friend Williams.
