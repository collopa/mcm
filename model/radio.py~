    # Decompose the input signal into its Fourier components, f_{0_{n}}(t) --> f_{0_{n}}(w)

    # Use the inverse Fourier transform to recompose the output signal, f_{n}(w) --> f_{n}(t)

    # Fresnel's equations require angle of incidence and indices of refraction of the two media.
    # The dispersive equations require the conductivity of air.
    # If angle of incidence is less than zero (less than parallel to the Earth's surface), odd N reflections are off of the ocean/land
    # If angle of incidence is greater than zero, even N reflections are off of the ionosphere
